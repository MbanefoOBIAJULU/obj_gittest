 <h3>Early Life</h3>
 <p>I was born in Markurdi in Benue state, and was opportuned to attend Tiny Tots Nursery and primary school where my father 
 was the Headmaster. 
 this school was actually the best schoolin Makurdi at the said time and was actually dominated by children of prominent 
 men in the society, i had as classmates children of Governors, Depuyt Governors and various commisioners.
 my father not only served s the bread winner of the family, but also served as the chauffeur of the family as he had to take us 
 daily to and fro school.</p>
 <p>life was actually not easy for the family as wehad o survive via hand to mouth. we basically were able to attend that school by virtue
 of my father as our school fees was deducted from his salary
 i started from Kindergattern as it was called, and then i moved through the ldder of academice. i was not actually a bright student at my early 
 days at school as i was at the bottom of the class majority of the times. i had just one guy that i always was ahead of.
 i had to skip primary 5 and moved to primary six from four. i became the Assistant time keeper. i graduated from primary schoolin the year 2003.
</p>
<h3>Social Life</h3>
<p>i was really not that sociable and did not have alot of friends, most of my friends were either from church or school,
i lived what was called a Triangle life, from school to church then to the house. in church i played th drums. i attended
  ECWA secondary school also in Makurdi. and graduated in the year 2009.</p>
 <h3>University days</h3>
 <p>after my graduation from secondary school, i travelled to enugu state where i stayed for a year with my cousin brother
working before i gained admission into the orestegious university of Nigeria NSUKKA, that was in the year 2010 to study
 Education Political Science. i was opportuned to make alot of good friends there and finally graduated with second class
  upper in the year 2014. during my days in school, i was engaged in a lot of activities to make ends meet. in my first 
  semester of my first year in school, i went for holiday in laagos to visit my cousin brother Nwalunor Tochukwu, on 
  getting there, i noticed he was a very busy man that was actually not always in the country, on one particular day,
  he was travelling to China and was meant to stay there for over one month. in a hurry, he handed my over lots of dollars
 and told me to help him and arrange them and keep it for him till e returns.
 did as i was directed, after several counting of the money, i discovered it was 101 picecs of one 100 dollars, the me
in me already made me to  understand that he meant to give me 100 picece, that the extra one was a mistake and adviced
 me to use the extra cash to get myself a new phone, the exchange rate as at then was 100 dollar to 15 thousand Naira. 
i continued to ponder over it, seconds turned into minuites, minuites into hours, hours into days, days into weeks,
weeks into moinths. then he returend from the journey, i immediately handed the cash over to him while calling his
 attention to the fact that he gave me 101 piceses as against 100. he just collected it and left, it was when i wanted
to go back to school that he called me and sat me down and now explained to me that the money he gave to me was 
actually a test, and that i passed it. that was how he took over everything concerning my education till i graduated.
